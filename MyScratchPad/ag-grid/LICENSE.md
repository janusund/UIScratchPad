WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT (“You”) IN RELATION TO AG-GRID-ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE GENERALLY MADE 
AVAILABLE IN SOURCE CODE FORMAT AND/OR AG-GRID-ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE GENERALLY MADE AVAILABLE IN OBJECT CODE FORMAT. 
(The ag-Grid-Enterprise is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Software”.)

RIGHTS GRANTED HEREIN APPLY ONLY TO SOFTWARE FOR WHICH YOU’VE PAID THE APPLICABLE FEE.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE DOWNLOADING,
COPYING, INSTALLATION OR ANY OTHER USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF AS YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO DO SO. 
THE SOFTWARE IS PROTECTED BY UNITED KINGDOM COPYRIGHT LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT LAWS, AS WELL AS OTHER 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AND TREATIES. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD.

THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT DESCRIBES YOUR RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND ITS COMPONENTS.

1.DEFINITIONS

“Application” means any software, application, or elements that Your Designated Users develop using the Software or 
Modifications in accordance with this Agreement; provided that any such Application (i) must have substantially 
different functionality than the Software, and (ii) must not allow any third party to use the ag-Grid-Enterprise, 
or any portion thereof, for software development or application development purposes.

“Designated User” shall mean a single distinct person for whom You have purchased a license to use the Software, 
whether such person is an employee acting within the scope of their employment with You or Your consultant or 
contractor acting within the scope of the services they provide for You. A Designated User can be replaced with a 
new Designated User as long as the number of concurrent Designated Users does not exceed that which the license
was purchased for.

“End User” means an end user of Your Application who acquires a license to such solely for their own internal use and 
not for distribution, resale, user interface design, or software development purposes.

“Modification” means: a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file included in the original 
ag-Grid-Enterprise or previous Modifications created by You, and/or b) any new file that leverages any part of the original 
ag-Grid-Enterprise or previous Modifications.

2.LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the payment of the fee required, and subject to Your compliance with all of the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement, We grant to You a revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license 
(i) for Designated User(s) to use the Software to create Modifications and Applications; (ii) for You to distribute the 
ag-Grid-Enterprise and/or Modifications to End Users solely as integrated into the Applications; and (iii) for End 
Users to use ag-Grid-Enterprise as integrated into Your Applications in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

In addition to the other terms contained herein, and subject to Your compliance with all of the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, We grant to You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to 
install and use the Software (the “Trial License”) strictly for Your internal evaluation and review purposes and not 
for production purposes. This Trial License applies only if You have registered with Us for a Trial License of the 
Software and shall be effective for sixty (60) consecutive days following the date of registration (“the Trial Period”). 
You may only register for a Trial License once in any six month period. You agree not to use a Trial License 
for any purpose other than determining whether to purchase a license to the Software. You are explicitly not permitted 
to distribute the Software to any user outside the Organization on whose behalf You have undertaken this license. 
Your rights to use the Trial License will immediately terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Trial 
Period, or (ii) such time that You purchase a license to the Software. We reserve the right to terminate Your Trial 
License at any time in Our absolute and sole discretion.

In addition to the other terms contained herein, in the event You have downloaded or received beta or pre-release 
versions of the Software (the “Beta Software”) from Us, subject to Your compliance with all of the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, We grant to You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to 
install and use the Beta Software strictly for Your internal evaluation and review purposes and not for production 
purposes (the “Beta License”). You are explicitly not permitted to distribute the Software to any user outside the 
Organization on whose behalf You have undertaken this license. Your rights to use the Beta Software will immediately 
terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the evaluation period established by Us, or (ii) such time that 
You purchase a license to a non-evaluation version of the Software. We reserve the right to terminate Your Beta License 
at any time in Our absolute and sole discretion.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TRIAL AND/OR BETA SOFTWARE MIGHT PLACE WATERMARKS ON OUTPUT, CONTAIN LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY, 
FUNCTION FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, OR LIMIT THE FUNCTIONALITY OR TIME OF FUNCTIONING OF ANY OUTPUT. ACCESS TO 
AND/OR USE OF ANY FILES OR OUTPUT CREATED WITH SUCH SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE ARE LICENSING THE 
SOFTWARE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WE DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY TO YOU OF ANY KIND.

3.OWNERSHIP

This is a license agreement and not an agreement for sale. We reserve ownership of all intellectual property rights 
inherent in or relating to the Software, which include, but are not limited to, all copyright, patent rights, all 
rights in relation to registered and unregistered trademarks (including service marks), confidential information 
(including trade secrets and know-how) and all rights other than those expressly granted by this Agreement.

We provide You with source code to the ag-Grid-Enterprise so that You can create Modifications and Applications. 
While You retain all rights to any original work authored by You as part of the Modifications, We continue to own all 
copyright and other intellectual property rights in the ag-Grid-Enterprise source.

You must not remove, obscure or interfere with any copyright, acknowledgment, attribution, trademark, warning or 
disclaimer statement affixed to, incorporated in or otherwise applied in connection with the Software.

4.PROHIBITED USES (ag-Grid-Enterprise)

You may not redistribute the ag-Grid-Enterprise code or Modifications other than by including the ag-Grid-Enterprise 
or a portion thereof within Your Application. You may not redistribute the ag-Grid-Enterprise code or Modifications 
as part of any Application that can be described as a development toolkit or library, an application builder, a 
website builder, a user interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by software, application, 
or website developers or designers. You may not change or remove the copyright notice from any of the files included
in ag-Grid or Modifications.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY YOU USE THE AG-GRID FOR AN APPLICATION THAT IS INTENDED FOR SOFTWARE 
OR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.

You are required to ensure that the ag-Grid-Enterprise is not reused by or with any applications other than those 
with which You distribute it as permitted herein. For example, if You install the ag-Grid-Enterprise on a customer’s 
server, that customer is not permitted to use the ag-Grid-Enterprise independently of Your Application.

5.TERMINATION

This Agreement and Your right to use the Software and Modifications will terminate immediately if You fail to comply 
with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon termination, You agree to immediately cease using and 
destroy the Software or Modifications, including all accompanying documents. The provisions of sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 10, and 11 will survive any termination of this Agreement.

6.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR RESELLERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, 
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION 
OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE CODE IT PRODUCES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT 
TECHNICALLY PRACTICABLE FOR US TO DO SO.

7.LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR RESELLERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL 
OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER 
PECUNIARY LAW) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE CODE IT PRODUCES OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT 
MATTER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF WE OR OUR RESELLERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
IN ANY CASE, OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO 
THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED BRITISH POUNDS (£500).

8.PAYMENT AND TAXES

If credit has been extended to You by Us, all payments under this Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date 
We mail an invoice to You. If We have not extended credit to You, You shall be required to make payment concurrent with 
the delivery of the Software by Us. Any value added tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax (“Transaction Taxes”) shall 
be Your sole responsibility. Each party shall pay all taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) 
or levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties as a result of this Agreement and any 
payments made hereunder (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments); provided that You shall be 
responsible for all Transactions Taxes and shall pay or reimburse Us for the same upon invoice. Each party shall 
furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, 
including original withholding tax certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Software ordered through Our resellers 
is subject to the fees and payment terms set forth on the applicable reseller invoice.

9.MISCELLANEOUS

The license granted herein applies only to the version of the Software available when purchased in connection with 
the terms of this Agreement, and to any updates and/or upgrades to which You may be entitled. Any previous or subsequent 
license granted to You for use of the Software shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement entered 
in connection with purchase or download of that version of the Software. Support and maintenance, including rights to 
updates and upgrades, are provided pursuant to the terms of the ag-Grid-Enterprise Support and Maintenance Agreement. 
You agree that You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Software, including without 
limitation all export and re-export control laws and regulations.

While redistributing the ag-Grid-Enterprise Support and Maintenance Agreement code or Modifications thereof as part of 
Your Application, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own 
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on our behalf. You shall indemnify Us and our resellers, or at Our option, 
defend Us and our resellers against any claim, suit or proceeding brought against Us or our resellers (i) arising by 
reason of Your accepting any such support, warranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the 
use, reproduction or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion 
of the ag-Grid-Enterprise therein. Further, You agree only to distribute the ag-Grid-Enterprise code pursuant to an 
enforceable written agreement for Our benefit that includes all the limitations and restrictions of this Agreement and 
is as protective of Us and ag-Grid-Enterprise code as is this Agreement.

You agree to be identified as a customer of Ours and You agree that We may refer to You by name, trade name and 
trademark, if applicable, and may briefly describe Your business in our marketing materials and web site.

You may not assign or transfer this Agreement without Our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or 
delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void. This Agreement may be assigned by Us in whole or part 
and will inure to the benefit of Our successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any instance in 
which You transfer ownership of an Application on a work for hire basis, You may assign licenses for the total 
Designated Users that have used the Software to develop said Application under this Agreement to another party 
(Assignee) provided (i) You provide written notice to Us prior to the effective date of such assignment; and 
(ii) the transfer is in quantities We generally make available to Our customers (minimum 5 Designated Users); 
and (iii) there is a written agreement, wherein the Assignee accepts the terms of this Agreement. Upon any such 
transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.

This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and 
cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 
No oral or written information given by Us, Our resellers, or otherwise on Our behalf shall create a warranty or 
collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such 
oral or written information. Any waivers or amendments shall be effective only if made in writing. Further, any 
different or additional terms of any related purchase order, confirmation, or similar form shall have no force or 
effect. The license granted herein is conditioned upon the acceptance of the terms and conditions hereof to the 
exclusion of all other terms, and no other or additional terms shall apply, unless so provided in writing signed 
by the parties hereto. You expressly agree by Your use of the Software that no such other, different or additional 
terms or conditions shall apply, notwithstanding any statements to the contrary included in any purchase order, 
confirmation, or similar form, and regardless of whether we accept payments referenced therein which shall not 
constitute acceptance of additional terms and conditions.

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those 
expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us and our licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are 
granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as applicable, with any other software or hardware 
not delivered by Us or Our resellers to You under this Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement apply only to 
Software, Modifications, and/or Applications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.

If any provision in this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the 
remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any remedy provided is determined to have 
failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement 
shall remain in effect. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement may not be deemed a 
waiver of that or any other provision of this Agreement.

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement 
and/or the Software shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction England and Wales, United Kingdom (notwithstanding 
conflicts of laws provisions), and all parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of England and Wales and further 
agree to commence any litigation which may arise hereunder or related hereto and/or to the Software in the 
judicial district of England and Wales, United Kingdom.
